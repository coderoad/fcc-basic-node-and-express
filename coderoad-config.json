      "content": "Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows developers to write backend (server-side) programs in JavaScript. Node.js comes with a handful of built-in modules - small, independent programs - that help facilitate this purpose. Some of the core modules include:\n\n- HTTP: a module that acts as a server\n- File System: a module that reads and modifies files\n- Path: a module for working with directory and file paths\n- Assertion Testing: a module that checks code against prescribed constraints\n\nExpress, while not included with Node.js, is another module often used with it. Express runs between the server created by Node.js and the frontend pages of a web application. Express also handles an application's routing. Routing directs users to the correct page based on their interaction with the application. While there are alternatives to using Express, its simplicity makes it a good place to begin when learning the interaction between a backend powered by Node.js and the frontend.\nDuring the development process, it is important to be able to check what’s going on in your code. Node is just a JavaScript environment. Like client side JavaScript, you can use the console to display useful debug information. On your local machine, you would see the console output in a terminal. On Glitch you can open the logs in the lower part of the screen. You can toggle the log panel with the button ‘Logs’ (lower-left, inside the tools menu).\n\nWe recommend to keep the log panel open while working at these challenges. By reading the logs, you can be aware of the nature of errors that may occur."

This object has several methods, and you will learn many of them in these challenges. One fundamental method is `app.listen(port)`. It tells your server to listen on a given port, putting it in running state. You can see it at the bottom of the file. It is inside comments because, for testing reasons, we need the app to be running in the background. All the code that you may want to add goes between these two fundamental parts. Glitch stores the port number in the environment variable `process.env.PORT`. Its value is `3000`.\n\nLet’s serve our first string! In Express, routes takes the following structure: `app.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER)`. METHOD is an http method in lowercase. PATH is a relative path on the server (it can be a string, or even a regular expression). HANDLER is a function that Express calls when the route is matched.\n\nHandlers take the form `function(req, res) {...}`, where req is the request object, and res is the response object. For example, the handler\n\n```js\nfunction(req, res) {\n  res.send('Response String');\n}\n```\n\nwill serve the string 'Response String'."

If you don’t know what middleware is... don’t worry, we will discuss in detail later. Basically, middleware are functions that intercept route handlers, adding some kind of information.

A <dfn>REST</dfn> (REpresentational State Transfer) API allows data exchange in a simple way, without the need for clients to know any detail about the server. The client only needs to know where the resource is (the URL), and the action it wants to perform on it (the verb). The GET verb is used when you are fetching some information, without modifying anything. These days, the preferred data format for moving information around the web is JSON. Simply put, JSON is a convenient way to represent a JavaScript object as a string, so it can be easily transmitted.\n\nLet's create a simple API by creating a route that responds with JSON at the path `/json`. You can do it as usual, with the `app.get()` method. Inside the route handler, use the method `res.json()`, passing in an object as an argument. This method closes the request-response loop, returning the data. Behind the scenes, it converts a valid JavaScript object into a string, then sets the appropriate headers to tell your browser that you are serving JSON, and sends the data back. A valid object has the usual structure `{key: data}`. `data` can be a number, a string, a nested object or an array. `data` can also be a variable or the result of a function call, in which case it will be evaluated before being converted into a string."

Note that there is a space between `method` and `path` and that the dash separating `path` and `ip` is surrounded by a space on both sides. You can get the request method (http verb), the relative route path, and the caller’s ip from the request object using `req.method`, `req.path` and `req.ip`. Remember to call `next()` when you are done, or your server will be stuck forever. Be sure to have the ‘Logs’ opened, and see what happens when some request arrives.\n\n**Note:** Express evaluates functions in the order they appear in the code. This is true for middleware too.

Middleware functions are functions that take 3 arguments: the request object, the response object, and the next function in the application’s request-response cycle. These functions execute some code that can have side effects on the app, and usually add information to the request or response objects. They can also end the cycle by sending a response when some condition is met. If they don’t send the response when they are done, they start the execution of the next function in the stack. This triggers calling the 3rd argument, `next()`.\n\nLook at the following example:\n\n```js\nfunction(req, res, next) {\n  console.log(\"I'm a middleware...\");\n  next();\n}\n```\n\nLet’s suppose you mounted this function on a route. When a request matches the route, it displays the string “I’m a middleware…”, then it executes the next function in the stack.\n\nIn this exercise, you are going to build root-level middleware. As you have seen in challenge 4, to mount a middleware function at root level, you can use the `app.use(&lt;mware-function&gt;)` method. In this case, the function will be executed for all the requests, but you can also set more specific conditions. For example, if you want a function to be executed only for POST requests, you could use `app.post(&lt;mware-function&gt;)`. Analogous methods exist for all the HTTP verbs (GET, DELETE, PUT, …)."

That leads to a better app structure, and the possibility to reuse code in different places. This approach can also be used to perform some validation on the data. At each point of the middleware stack you can block the execution of the current chain and pass control to functions specifically designed to handle errors. Or you can pass control to the next matching route, to handle special cases. We will see how in the advanced Express section."

This is a part of the HTML request, also called payload. Since HTML is text-based, even if you don’t see the data, it doesn’t mean that it is secret. The raw content of an HTTP POST request is shown below:\n\n```http\nPOST /path/subpath HTTP/1.0\nFrom: john@example.com\nUser-Agent: someBrowser/1.0\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nContent-Length: 20\nname=John+Doe&age=25\n```\n\nAs you can see, the body is encoded like the query string.
